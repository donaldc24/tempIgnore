Changed code from mine to the 1.05 solution to start with
Next I changed the files to .cpp
I then changed my structs to classes and compiled
Fixed compiled errors which were mainly type casting
Made seperate file for parsing the needed csv
Added file search and input
Then moved parsing code in with main code
