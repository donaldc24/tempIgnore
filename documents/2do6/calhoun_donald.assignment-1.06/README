This is my pokemon c code for 1.06, which meets all of the specified requirements as follows:
	- Converted all but heap files to cpp
	- Still compiles map but doesn't display it
	- Parses the needed files in the right locations
	- Prints out the parsed info based on file given
	- Uses inheritance for NPC and PC
	- Makes classes for each type with the parsed files
	- Changed from structs to classes
